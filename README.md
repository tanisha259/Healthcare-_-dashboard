## ✨Key Features
- **Patient Data Analysis**: Visualizes patient demographics, admission rates, and recovery trends.
- **Resource Management**: Tracks resource usage, including bed occupancy, medical supplies, and staff distribution.
- **Performance Insights**: Monitors hospital and department performance with key indicators like average length of stay and patient satisfaction.

## 🛠️Tools and Technologies
- **Power BI**: Used for creating interactive dashboards and visualizations.
- **Data Sources**: The project uses a healthcare dataset for analysis (included in the repository).
- **ERD Diagram**: Visual representation of the data model used in the dashboard (included in the repository).

## 📁Dataset
The project uses a healthcare dataset [healthcare_dataset.xlsx](https://github.com/codewithhusan/Healthcare-Dashboard-PowerBI/blob/main/healthcare_dataset.xlsx) to analyze key metrics such as:
- **Patient Demographics**: Age, gender, and geographic distribution.
- **Hospital Resources**: Bed occupancy, staff allocation, and medical supplies.
- **Performance Metrics**: Length of stay, recovery times, and patient satisfaction scores.

The dataset provides a comprehensive view of the hospital's operations, allowing for insightful analysis and visualization.

## 🖥️How to Use
1. Download the [Healthcare_Dashboard.pbix](https://github.com/codewithhusan/Healthcare-Dashboard-PowerBI/blob/main/healthcare_dataset_dashboard.pbix) file from the repository.
2. Open the file in Power BI Desktop to explore the dashboard.
3. Use the ERD diagram to understand the data structure and relationships.

## 💡Insights
- **Key Trends**: Highlighted trends in patient care and resource utilization.
- **Opportunities for Optimization**: Identified potential areas for process improvements in healthcare resource management.
